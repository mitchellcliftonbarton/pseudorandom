# Pseudorandom Landscape

//////////////////////////////////////////////

Pseudorandom Landscape is an art project created by [Mitchell Barton](http://mitchellbarton.com) and Keith Moore. 

The site for this project can be found at [https://pseudorandom-landscape.com](https://pseudorandom-landscape.com).

The project also comes in book form, availabe as a free downloadable [PDF](http://mitchellbarton.com/pseudorandom-landscape) or for purchase [IRL](http://actualsource.org/products/pseudorandom-landscape).

Pseudorandomness is a term used to describe computational processes or systems that appear to be random but are actually not. This type of process imitates reality, creating an illusion of a natural process while actually fundamentally being a list of instructions that produces fixed outcomes based on the information it is given. 

The images in the project are a collection of computer generated abstractions from landscape imagery that have been created from this type of process through the input of names.

### Development

The website was built with node.js, if you feel like taking a look at the code, feel free to clone this repository and mess around with it. If you have questions, contact me through email at mitchellcliftonbarton@gmail.com.
